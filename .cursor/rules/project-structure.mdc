- **`/native`**: A React Native mobile application. The entry point is `[native/App.tsx](mdc:native/App.tsx)`.
- **`/pocketbase`**: The backend service, using [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/). It includes data migrations and the executable.
- **`/components`**: Shared React components used by the Next.js web application.
- **`/lib`**: Contains shared libraries and client-side code for interacting with services like PocketBase (`[lib/pocketbase.ts](mdc:lib/pocketbase.ts)`) and Cloudflare R2 (`[lib/r2-client.ts](mdc:lib/r2-client.ts)`).
