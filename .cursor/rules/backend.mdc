# Backend: PocketBase & Cloudflare R2

The backend is powered by [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/), a self-contained Go backend.

- **Directory**: `[pocketbase/](mdc:pocketbase/)`
- **Data Migrations**: Schema changes are in `[pocketbase/pb_migrations/](mdc:pocketbase/pb_migrations/)`.
- **Client**: A PocketBase client is initialized in `[lib/pocketbase.ts](mdc:lib/pocketbase.ts)`.

For file storage, the application uses Cloudflare R2.

- **R2 Client**: The client for interacting with R2 is in `[lib/r2-client.ts](mdc:lib/r2-client.ts)`.
- **Uploads**: File uploads are handled by the API route at `[app/api/upload/route.ts](mdc:app/api/upload/route.ts)`.
- **Setup**: The guide for setting up R2 is in `[CLOUDFLARE_R2_SETUP.md](mdc:CLOUDFLARE_R2_SETUP.md)`.
