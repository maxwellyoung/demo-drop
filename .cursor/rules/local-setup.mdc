To get started with local development, refer to the detailed guide in `[LOCAL_SETUP.md](mdc:LOCAL_SETUP.md)`.

The general steps are:
1.  Install web dependencies with `npm install`.
2.  Install mobile dependencies by running `npm install` inside the `[native/](mdc:native/)` directory.
3.  Start the PocketBase backend.
4.  Start the Next.js development server.
